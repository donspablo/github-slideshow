<p align="center"><i>My passion in open-source software development has developed to the point that I am actively seeking financial aid to assist me in accomplishing both professional and personal goals. The funds will enable me to continue working full-time and developing fantastic applications, in addition to upgrading and maintaining my existing ones. I have created a fundraising page specifically for the purpose of storing my related fundraising materials. Your support would be really helpful and greatly appreciated - Thank you üôè</i></p>

# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji üìñ next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

This course is using the :sparkles: open source project [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). In some cases we‚Äôve made changes to the history so it would behave during class, so head to the original project repo to learn more about the cool people behind this project.
